save keymap:
 `C:\Users\<your_username>\.IntelliJIdea<version>\config\keymaps`

1. Copy the desired `.xml` file(s) from the keymaps directory to a backup location (e.g., a USB drive or cloud storage).



### Importing Keymaps on Another IntelliJ Installation
1. Open **Settings** (or **Preferences** on macOS) on your new IntelliJ installation.
2. Again, navigate to the **Keymap** section.
3. Place your exported `.xml` file in the keymaps directory on the new installation:
    - Use the same paths as mentioned earlier based on your operating system.

4. After the file is placed in the keymaps directory, restart IntelliJ IDEA.
5. Once restarted, go to **Keymap** settings, and your custom keymap should now appear in the dropdown list for selection.



### Sync Keymaps Across Devices with JetBrains Settings Repository
Alternatively, JetBrains provides a **Settings Repository** solution to sync various settings (including keymaps) across installations:
1. Go to **File > Manage IDE Settings > Settings Repository**.
2. Use the **Share Settings** feature:
    - You can push your settings—including keymaps—to a Git repository.

3. On the new installation:
    - Clone the repository in the Settings Repository dialog to pull the configuration, which includes your keymaps.

This approach is particularly useful if you want long-term synchronization or have multiple devices.

### 1. **Use JetBrains Sync Across Products**
JetBrains provides a built-in synchronization system that allows you to sync your settings (keymaps, themes, plugins, etc.) across different IDEs tied to the same JetBrains user account.
#### Steps to Enable Sync:
1. Go to **File > Manage IDE Settings > Settings Sync**.
2. Click **Enable Settings Sync**.
3. Log in to your JetBrains account (if not already logged in).
4. After enabling, the IDE will synchronize your settings to the cloud.
5. Open your other JetBrains IDE (like WebStorm, PyCharm, etc.) and enable **Settings Sync** in the same way.

When you enable sync in different JetBrains IDEs, your shared settings—including keymaps and plugins—are automatically downloaded.

> ⚠️ Note: While some settings and plugins are shared universally, language-specific settings (like Java-related settings in IntelliJ IDEA) won’t transfer to other IDEs like PyCharm or WebStorm.




### 2. **Manual Copy for Keymaps and Settings**
If you prefer manual control or don’t want to use the cloud sync:
#### Keymaps:
1. Locate the keymap XML file on your computer. Keymaps are stored in:
    - **Windows**: `C:\Users\<your_username>\.IntelliJIdea<version>\config\keymaps`
    - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea<version>/keymaps`
    - **Linux**: `~/.config/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea<version>/keymaps`

2. Copy the `.xml` file from IntelliJ IDEA's `keymaps` directory to the corresponding directory of the other JetBrains products.
    - The keymaps directory is the same for all JetBrains IDEs; just replace `<product_name>` in the path.

#### Other Settings:
Settings such as themes, tools, and some preferences are stored in configuration folders specific to each product. To copy these settings:
1. Locate the IntelliJ IDEA configuration directory:
    - **Windows**: `C:\Users\<your_username>\.IntelliJIdea<version>\config`
    - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea<version>`
    - **Linux**: `~/.config/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea<version>`

2. Copy the relevant settings (e.g., `options`, `plugins`, etc.) from that folder to the equivalent directory in the target JetBrains IDE.




### 3. **Use the Export/Import Settings Feature**
JetBrains IDEs allow you to export IDE settings as a `.zip` file that can be imported into another IDE. This is ideal for transferring settings across IDEs.
1. From IntelliJ IDEA, go to **File > Manage IDE Settings > Export Settings**.
    - Select the settings you want to export (keymaps, plugins, UI themes, etc.).
    - Save the `.zip` file.

2. Open the target IDE (e.g., PyCharm), and go to **File > Manage IDE Settings > Import Settings**.
    - Select the `.zip` file saved earlier.

This will apply your IntelliJ IDEA settings to the other JetBrains IDE.




### 4. **Share Settings via Settings Repository**
You can use JetBrains' **Settings Repository** to store and retrieve your settings via a Git repository.
#### Steps:
1. Go to **File > Manage IDE Settings > Settings Repository**.
2. Set up a Git repository, push your settings, and commit them.
3. In your other JetBrains IDE, clone the same repository from **Settings Repository**.
    - This will pull your IntelliJ settings (including keymaps, plugins, etc.) into the other IDE.



### 5. **Sync Plugins**
Plugins can also be synced automatically:
1. In **Settings Sync** (or manually through export/import), enable plugin synchronization.
2. Plugins that are compatible across JetBrains IDEs will be installed automatically in the other products.
